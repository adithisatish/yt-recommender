1.)Napoleon Hill - Think and Grow Rich 
2.) Rhonda Byrne- The secret 
3.) Robert Kiyosaki - Rich Dad Poor Dad
J. - I've read everything on this list several times and here are a few changes I'd make:

Napoleon Hill's Laws of Success.  Nobody read's this but it taught me far more than Think and Grow Rich.  Think and Grow Rich is more of a generality, Laws of Success really hammers it all home.
Wayne Ndlovu - Just read Rich dad Poor Dad. It's amazing.
Mihir Gadhvi - While watching this video i closed my eyes so I can‚Äôt judge the book by its cover
Syed Noor Mohammed - ""When to read?"" This is been very helpful

Mohammadbagher Azarkaman - ""The secret of millioners mind"" is my favorite and it is life changing
Syed Noor Mohammed - ""When to read?"" Superb idea..
Torry Terry - hello my name is Torry Terry, and I am the Author of the book ""The Locks Hated on with a smile."" I am from Miami Florida and was lucky enough to have a stepfather who was one of the original Gangsters from a city called Opa-Locka in Miami Florida named Chilly Willie.  he told me how it was in the late 80's and early 90's in Miami involving the African Americans. too many times we hear about the Cubans and the Colombians back then, but rarely the Black people. This inspired me to write this BASED ON A TRUE STORY book. its a book that intriguing, dramatic and a lesson learner for those in the dope game. I hope you all get the book and enjoy it.
