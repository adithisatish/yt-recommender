Amazing

YouTube USA - ""HE IS AN ANGELLL!!!!!!!""
Abbie Wilson - i’ve always been a slow reader but love reading. over the years ive just given up on it, so my 2020 resolution was to read more with a goal of 20 this year- i really committed and i’m currently reading book 14! i’ve upped my goal to 40 book this year 🤓
Nicola Paredes-Rupp - If you like Haruki Murakami PLEASE read his book Norwegian Wood!! It is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read:)
Kyla Ruth - No one:
Cami: ""I freakin love this book!"" 
😂
Madison P - The guy at the bookstore said I like to read realistic tragedies or something like that. Basically he said I liked to read books that are realistic but really messed up with how sad or tragic they are.
 - Soooo I realized after posting this that I got too excited about my love for books & instead of properly telling you what each book is about, I just told you why I love them lolol🙈So, if any of these books intrigue you, I recommend looking them up on goodreads.com- they always have good descriptions/blurbs (and reviews) on there :) Hope y'all are holding up okay during this weird time! Lots of love!💗(ps- take a shot everytime I say ""atmosphere"" and ""poetic"" lmao)
Jordy San - thank you for making my quarantine better, you are the best!!
Annalise Gallagher - when you were talking about the girl with the dragon tattoo I thought you were gonna say you were only reading it because you were trying to impress the guy's sister lmaoo

Me: YOU!

Niyati Nanavaty - Finally, a youtuber who didn't recommend the same old John Green and Nicola Yoon books in her video

tend the rabbits - Book 👏 Shelf 👏 Tour 👏
Also, I have The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo on my bookshelf waiting to be read after I finish the one I’m currently on!
As for recommendations, my favorite book ever is A Clockwork Orange...it’s written kinda all in slangy English-Russian but you come to understand it and it has good themes and huge tw but I love it so much :)
arcadiankiss - That slightly awkward moment when you come to a video looking for book recommendations, but you've already read all the books in the list 😂 definitely some excellent choices!
Also, I've literally never met anyone who doesn't like Perfume by Patrick Süskind! All the people I know who've already read it and the people I've recommended it to (and that's been a lot) have loved it!

lily hadd - when girls talk about books i simp 😔✊🏼
Gabrielle Smith - description of every  book: really explores how ~we live in a society~
Mariel Stoltzfus - OMG THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY I FORGOT THAT WAS ONE OF MY FAV BOOKS AS WELL. OMGGGGG OSCAR WILDE IS AMAZING. Also if you love that one read the importance of being Earnest by Oscar Wilde, its a completely different tone and atmosphere, but it is hilarious with it's sarcasm! There should be a Cami book club/ forum/ thread thing :).
Melinda Glinac - Parfume is one of my all time favorite books too, I also love a few others you´ve mentioned. So I will definitely check out all the others you recommend, I think we have a very similar taste in books and you should make more of these kinds of videos. 🤩
Zelda Henson - Cami: You can listen Audiobooks while you try to drown OUT your family.
What I heard: You can listen to Audiobooks while you try to DROWN your family.

TakeMeToParadize - I love how I always happen to find the gays even when I’m just trying to get some book recs. YouTube gets me
Kelly Rob - My favorite book is Endless Love by Scott Spenser. I read it first when I was 15 yrs old and it really fucked with my head and idea of relationships. I’m 52 now. I’ve read it several times in my life and there’s just something abt this damn book that I’ve never shaken and always came back too. I still love it.
Ella Enchanted - I am in love Lisbeth. She is so my favorite character of all time.

Madison Elyse - i love love how happy you are when youre talking about books haha
Neria Charalampous Perdiki - I agree so much when it comes to Dorian Grey! It has to be one of my favorite gothic classics? Definitely my all-time favorite classic. Oscar's characters are so complex and the quotes in the book were so fookin poetic

Quan Anh - I think you will like A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara, it's my all time favourite book and the writing is absolutely beautiful!

Supreetha Devarakonda - So refreshing to see some new books.. And a the fact that your books are not all hardcover and a little soiled. It makes feel better about my books and I'm sure others feel like that too Coz not everyone can afford hardcopies or brand new copies and have enough space at home to keep all the books super new and clean. Thank you for the recs Cami! I'm watching your content for the first time and I love you already! ♡
Zofia Zalewska - You look so pretty in your haircut😍
Camerin Sanchez - Me watching the video needing recommendations: *noticing you are very pretty*: :)

Also also me: *hearing that the story of the guy ended with you being gay*: :)))
Daisy Reyes - The smile/giggle at 2:55 🥵😍❤️
Kelsey Aikens - The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a wonderful book and I honestly love the original trilogy. There’s actually a real life mystery behind the author of the series.
A few others that I personally love is The Time Traveler’s Wife and The Lovely Bones.
Mohsa - Loving these recommendations. You’ve got to check out “The Song of Achilles” by Madeline Miller, I know you’d absolutely LOVE it based on your favorites!
Cat Corral - The Picture of Dorian Gray is hands down one of my favorite book too! 🤍

salma nour - I loved ""the girl with the dragon tattoo"" both book and movie  ❤️
Caroline - I love finding someone that has my same favorite author! Not enough people talk about Murakami
Kanwar Anand - Finally a list where I’ve read most of the books. I loved that you used such words for Dracula. Dorian Gray is probably the best book of all time. Basic, DG and LH are the best characters. You could have also included secret history by DT. Anyway I subscribed. I’m excited about the darkness book. I gotta read more by murakami. An ex girlfriend recommended Kafka so when I read it I looked at it cynically and found it loose ended. Then i read the book he wrote about running and it was great.
Christin Heinrich - this made me remember that I actually do have a book by Murakami that I wanted to read ages ago but never got past the first 10 pages. I really want to read it now.. but also watch anime and study korean helppp 😅
Sarah Levine - So you were actually trying to impress his sister 🤭
Sarah Young - I almost screamed when you said Dracula, I love that book so much and it seems like no one has read it!!

Katie Hanson - Haruki Murakami is my favorite author of all time. He’s just Murakami and I get your love
Daniela Shchegelskaya - I love how you talk about the book ""The girl with a dragon tattoo"" and I looked at your earrings and I was like hell yeah this girl is cool! Love your earrings and ""attention to detail""! Plus your style is awesome! Thank you for the book recommendations! edit: sorry got excited and wrote the title wrong! it is ""the girl"" le girl le unique girl

Larissa Jordaan - I love The Picture of Dorian Gray, well the part I read, I've read it till the middle, I cant finish it because I get too emotionally overwhelmed😭
Nanette Marie - if you'd like cheap used/new books, I HIGHLY recommend thriftbooks !!
Anja Richner - ""Das Parfüm"" (the parfume) is one of my favorit books as well, and I'm very sorry to say that, but the way you pronounce the name of the main protagonist made me laugh very hard. It was very sweet and I know french names can be quit difficult (If it helps it should sound a bit like: ""Cronui""). And I probably pronounce the majority of names in books written by english or american authors wrong, so there we go :)
Karolina Podrzycka - It's the first time that I'm at your chanel and I LOVE your editing and the ENERGY!!! I'll be back, promise!

Dog Bad - I only read digitally because I can’t afford physical copies 

And also, when you said “turns out I really enjoyed it” I was thinking, I’m surprised that you didn’t say it but then you did. One of the reasons I love you and your personality.
Captain Jack Sparrow - The atmosphere Dracula creates is an aesthetic: Dark Academia
:)
ur friend, love - ""you know what's sexy?""

...omg cami i see you trying to seduce your audience with your first date top on!

Neria Charalampous Perdiki - You like bukowski? OMG WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE. He is my favorite and whenever I try to tell my friends that he is worth a try they look at me like I grew two heads ahahaahha
Linzy M. Nuñez C. - This is my first time watching you and lemme tell you, you have such a NICE and effortlessly beautiful aura.
VICARI - Baby girl.... Murakami is my favorite author, too. And I NEEED to tell you, LISTEN to 1Q84 by him. It is. The best book hes ever written. And then go  LISTEN to Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follet. Youre welcome<3
Seth V - I will never get laid lmao. All my books are on my kindle except the ones that I cant get on kindle. Ig it can be my little secret.
Antonia Karimi - I just finished reading The Picture of Dorian Gray and WOW! I had the same reaction as you when I read the ending; I literally sat gobsmacked from what I read!
Kate Filipuzzi - Hey girl! Just found your channel and I'm already in love... One recommendation for you is Let Me In by John Ajvide Lindqvist! Familiar to your description of Perfume and I'm sure just as gritty and weird :) 
Quick question for anyone listening, is Perfume what the Netflix show is based off of?
Sophie - I've been thinking about reading some fiction books but Couldn't find ones that would fit my style. And thanks to this video, I know what I want to add i to my TBR list. Love this 💕
Sarah Young - The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is one of my favorite books that I would recommend to any and everyone.  She really beautifully intertwines the real world ~1900 and magic and love (even though I'm not usually one to read a romance novel.
The number 1 thing that makes this my favorite book is the fact that I have never gotten so completely sucked into a story, this book will seriously make you believe in it and its amazing
Karina Rimkuse - omgg yesss! I looove Murakami, he is one of the only authors that i love everything that he has written!
seriouslykass - I ove your style- on such a rainy UK summer day you made my Sunday

Anna Adámková - you got me on the girl with the dragon tattoo, love that
seraphina m - We looper literature cami❤️❤️
Victoria Hatzson - I'll never stop supporting physical forms of media and books, for me part of the experience is holding and reading the actual thing that the writer produced.
Даниела Иванова - Also Perfume is an amazing story! It's one of the first books I tackled in German and man, the author is a master and you can really appreciate the richness of the language.
With Bukowski I didn't feel it was the mood that made me feel uncomfortable rather than the blatant misogyny. Granted I haven't read this particular books but all the rest I tried from him were saturated with it and it really put me off.

Nicole Mackey - I highly recommend Little Women by L.M Alcott!!! Also lovedddd this video :)
Shanan Dobson - wow thats alot of energy, real interesting picks too, interested to try the magical surrealism.  books i'd recommend Robert Rankin he writes nonsense books their really warped and Fun (e.g. hollow chocolate bunnies of the Apocalypse and knees up mother earth) and Kevin Brooks bit harder to describe but so good (i recommend Black rabbit summer and Being).

Nene - Magical realism, never thought I'd heard that outside of my Language (the equivalent of English B in my native language, Spanish) class. If you like that style of writing you should check some latin american authors like Julio Cortázar and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, they have some amazing novels that I really enjoyed reading for class

violetsandsunsets - i see the girl with the dragon tattoo, and i know you're cultured
Megan Huxley - Love your choices! Murakami is my absolute favorite. I've read all of his work twice over and feel sad that I'll never experience it for the first time again. Reading his work was like stepping into the world that I've always lived in, but it wasn't created by me--and also far more interesting. So I found both safety and exploration within his work.
Hristian Krastev - Actually i survived the quartine with the hunger games trilogy. They are actually amazing i was obsessed.
maddy miller - I love the wind up bird chronicle but couldn’t get over how weirdly the author talks about women
Taylor Tea - If your like me and started reading because you wanted to watch the movie, here’s my list:
-The Shining (5 stars, my favourite book)
-Carrie
-The Hunger Games series (the first book is the best, the other two are okay but you might under the movies better if you read them ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
Reese - Girl, you were totally trying to empress the sister 😜
BillyBee789 - Read ""Dracula"" in 1973 on a 2-day, 2-night bus ride from Denver, Co, to Richmond, Va. I think I've been a little warped ever since...but it was worth it.

Elie Barbar - omg we have the same copy of ""The Picutre of Dorian Gray"" and i've read a few of these tehe
Charmoli Apum Khrime - You are like one of my classmate; very energetic and animated.
C T - me wondering why this wasn't called ten books you need to read
Hannah Marks - You should read the southern book club guide to slaying vampires!! It definitely has a gothic literature vibe
Benedetta Cherchi - I just finished reading Steig Larsson's trilogy and I couldn't put it down!!! Definitely recommended to everyone

shruti panda - girl with the dragon tattoo is puregold! i loved it so so so much !!!
luvblue00 - YES TO THE HARUKI MURAKAMI INCLUSION AHHH I'm so excited about this because I never see him on people's lists and he's literally such a brilliant author
Khansa Kiasati - Heeeyyy i also like murakami, it's kinda hard to finish one at first, but once i did, i cant help but read the other books written by him!
Moa Åhs - Love it! I assume you know, but there are two more books after the girl with the dragon tattoo, and actually there is another author that has written, I think 2 more about Lisbeth since Stieg Larsson died! All great books!

ashley the gemini - I just posted a video about what its like to work at amazon during quarantine!!!! also love u cami 💘
KgMcClintictock - Based on this list I think you would really like ""Her Body and Other Parties"" by Carmen Machado. It a series of feminist, surreal fictional short stories with a touch of horror.
Jess Sutton - Yessssss! This is myyyyy kindaaaa videooooo!
Emilia R. - Just had to order some books online 😂 there is a Barnes and nobles leather bound edition of Dracula and I thought why not order it, now that you reminded me of that ... And I also ordered Kafka at the shore, because there is one book of Murakami that I once read and really liked. I think I just read it in the perfect moment and in the perfect mood for the story. I don't know how the original title is but if I translate the German title it would be called ""Naokos Smile"". I also really liked ""The perfume""  by Patrick Süsskind. I  read it in german because I'm from Berlin and I can imagine that saying his name is a little difficult if you don't have a clue of german pronounciation😂 That was a really great video, thanks and greetings from Berlin
SoundandtheMessenger - You kind of have an Alton Brown thing going lately... I like it :)
Valeria Carrasco Ferrari - Cami I f*cking love u 💕 ur such an inspiration really

Chubby Bunny WL - Watched this video and then  looked at 7 different YouTubers in the past hour with the same kind of video..and none had the same book taste more than you. Or the enthusiasm and detail you give!  My go to YouTube for books!
Rana Arar - perfume is my all time favorite i was shocked to even know there are beings on this earth whom i share oxygen with that dislike it.. tf grow up. nothing in my opinion can top this book its a masterpiece and for those whom are still reluctant to read it i am urging you to and i will tell you right now that youre missing out BiG TImE! go! read! Perfume the story of a murderer! and fall inlove with Grenouille!
rainepanda - totally agree with that quote or at least make sure you're f*cking someone who can match you intellectually haha
Daneesha Ko - I subscribed the moment she mentioned Perfume.
The Vegan Eye - You need to make a discord and make one of the section book club
Hannah H - watching your videos always puts me in a great mood. i love your content with my whole heart, thank you for being you!
Julie Smith - You’re precious. I’m smiling so big right now like omg so cute
raloria9173 - I love your book videos SO MUCH!!!!! You should definitely do more of these.  :)
Marina Magnelli - Yessss I will for sure take you up on some of these suggestions! 👌🏽 although I will say I don’t have a bookshelf/many books of my own just because I get all my books from the library! I don’t love rereading things so I don’t find much use in owning books myself, personally. Maybe that’s why I’m single. 😂
Amanda Kalinoski - I've been wanting to read Murakami for so long but was putting it off but now you convinced me
Savannah Wappler - I want to be her friend. This is the first video I have watched of her’s, but she is really cool!
khakis - This vid came out at the right time for me.. I can't quarantine since I have to work, regardless.. I'm really wanting to get into reading lately. I've never been a huge reader but if it's Good, I might just finish

Hannah Snow - you have a very good taste in literature. the books i haven't read on your list, i intend to!
Nilu Lal - You are Awesome!! Subscribed!!😊 i love your excitement, passion n i love the energy!! I love love love books too!!😍 Excellent book selections.
lisasbooklife -Lisa Hennessey - As a fellow booknerd, I absolutely loved this video! I currently have 125 books on my physical TBR in my personal home library and I've now added a few more thanks to this video!

Also, audiobooks are amazing and IT DOES COUNT AS READING to anyone wanting to argue that. You are still consuming a story, just in a different format (don't even say blind people who rely on audio to read aren't reading. They are!) But, another amazing way to get audiobooks is through your local library! My library has 4 different apps I can use to consume audiobooks all for free! So support your local libraries if you can't afford to purchase books/audiobooks.
jessica king - I recommend you to read birthday by meridith Russo. it’s the best book I’ve ever read an lgbt book, absolutely amazing read!
Sara - I used to love reading when I was a teenager, and then I went to college, and they gave us boring books to read, and now I don’t read anymore. Like seriously I used to skip meals because I was too focused on my books, go to bed at 3am because « I’ll just finish this chapter » and now I genuinely don’t ever feel like reading, I started Animal Farm 3 months ago and I liked it, but I still haven’t read the last chapter. Like 🤯
Aya Bookz - 💛💛Too lazy to read books?

Mia Abad - Please read The thorn birds by Colleen McCullough! It’s really good!
Megan Tatiana Kerr - Just for that intro I'm subscribing.
TheDarrenH30 - Wow! What a refreshing book review video and a great selection of books. I’m so tired of seeing some teenage girl sitting in front of her bookshelves blathering on about herself for the first five minutes and then talking about her TBR books that all need to have red covers or must have the word “heart” in the title or a heart on the cover. WTF?! This was so refreshing and your energy was infectious. I was unfamiliar with a couple of your titles but will look into them because I really liked your other choices. Thank you. You did a great job!
aya !! - omg i love ur book recs
Mackenzie the Mystic - I love this! You have good taste! I LOVE that quote lol. I can usually tell if I'm going to get along & vibe w someone the first moment they walk into my house & react (bc there's always, inevitably a reaction...) to my 3K+ book collection... it's either WOW!!! or ...wow? Hahahhaa.
Deb - I think you would make a great actress- replace AH amber heard - your cooler and prettier than her....you would stay true to you and I'd pay to watch you in the cinema, haha :)

Adarea Dorou - I love these videos x'DD
Ranel Toledo - Thanks to this video, I just realized that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is my favorite fiction series. Nothing compares!! Also love your choice of Murakami (I’ve read Norwegian Wood, Kafka on the Shore, Wind Up Bird Chronicles). I’m super glad I’ve rekindled my love for reading — and actually finishing books — last year.
ElvenIvy07 - Looking uber gay Cami! I like! 👏👏👏😍
Madalena Torrinha - PLEASE for the sake of this quarantine time I URGE YOU to read ""Blindness"" by José Saramago, a Portuguese author. I read it already and its one of the most pertinent books I've ever read, ESPECIALLY NOW, beside the fact it has a gripping storyline and very well thoughout characters and one of the most beautiful writing I've ever seen.
Brianna Pollock - You should totally read Norwegian wood! It’s my favorite murakami

im baby ت - your smile is so pretty 🥺👉🏼👈🏼

Gosty - 8:41 hahahahaha hell yeaah

Elizabeth Manning - You seriously remind me of Lilly from princess diaries
Corinna Nittmann - The ""kind"" in süskind is pronounced like kindle but without the ""le"" :) you got the ""süs"" right
Lady Greyjoy - The Wall by Marlen Haushofer is amazing! It's about a woman who wakes up one day and finds herself separated from the rest of the world by an invisible wall, and has to learn to survive in the wilderness with a dog, a cat and a cow as her only companions. It's beautiful and heartbreaking and totally worth it.
Robert Guajardo - Let's show cami how much we love her and please continue subscribing to her YouTube channel also please stay safe during the virus pandemic and my favorite book is Silence by Camilla Nicole Petyn and where can you get it from i bet your asking well my dear commenter you can get this amazing and wonderful book off Amazon😊❤
Alyssa Wood - How many backgrounds do you use for this video 😂 so many different beds and areas
India-Jazmine Saax - If you pay close attention, I don’t think any of the books would have “more darker” written in them. This is a very nice video though.
Julie Vandemoere - This is the first video I watch on your channel but omg you're such a ball of sunshine and happiness! You give me such happy energy and you're so passionate in how you talk! Sorry if this is weird haha but you genuinely seem like such a nice and fun person :)

Sidney Demuth - girlll read a little life by hanya yanagihara ! best book ive ever read hands down
Stephanie K. - My fiancé doesn’t have the ability to picture in his mind what’s going on in the book. Instead he lives vicariously through me because I always keep him updated on what’s going on in whatever book I’m reading.
Elizabeth lussier - Did you read The Historian and Dracula by Elizabeth Kostova... really  creepy in a good sense ;)
Carlos Salazar - Thanks I bought 3
Daria Dorato - I agree with previous comments that the whole Millennium trilogy, including the Girl with Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson is freakin brilliant... Unfortunately he got heart attack before the publication and the fourth, continuation book The Girl in the Spider's Web was written by the other author...
Top 10 - I like the entry, lol, i always found books boring
Heather Tez - Man you had me engaged, you're so pretty and entertaining.... Then you said bram stokers Dracula was a good read. You've never finished it or have you?? I only say that because most people say they've read it, but are lairs!!! They quote the movie, not the book. 🤣  It's the most boring book I've ever read. It's the top of my worst book list. Best movie, worst book.
miss kya - you should read a little life by hanya yanagihara. pretty dark and poetic! so right up yr alley. :•)
Lucas Crafes - i just saved you  17:39 minutes, you should go now and read a chapter of one of these books.
1- 1:13

3- i got bored lol

Lil S. - the way you pronounce süßkind is like 'sewskinned'
Filipa Martins - Hi Cami 😊 the girl with the dragon tattoo is actually the first of a trilogy. ..check out the others if you loved it
mali lee - i’d just like to point out that after studying dracula for a level that it’s really not that straightforward - it follows an epistolary narrative (in the format of letters and journal entries) and the dates on these letters don’t always match up so you definitely need to look out for that! maybe for readers who are reading for leisure it’s wouldn’t be such a massive deal to
Avalon Seckinger - I WANT YOUR EARRINGS WHERE ARE THEY FROM
Amandareadstoomuch 99 - WIND UP WAS A TRIP

Sonja25997 - I think you would really enjoy The Sandman by E. T. A. Hofmann.
It kind of has a similar dark feel like Patick Süßkinds novel. (also: your first pronounciation was almost correct! You just have to say the n more German^^) 
It deals with a Protagonist that is losing himself in his inner darkness that may or may not be a result of real situations or his fantasy playing tricks on him.
riri - You also need to read 'Who will cry when you die' by Robin Sharma! oof that book is so so good i can't even..it's got 100 things you gotta do before you die to leave behind a legacy and all..like i can't even describe it properly it's that good! btw, love from India★

RazDazThem - Hahah you know whys sexy 📚 books... lol 🤓 brainy 😉✨..
Victoria Lim - That intro I replayed so many times because it cracked me up so much! To those of you who don’t want to pay for audiobooks / audible in the Long run and have a library card, would highly recommend an app called Libby which connects you to any library you have a library (internationally) and you can listen to audiobooks on there for F R E E !! Of course it only works if your library has a good stock of audiobooks, but doing this has allowed me to access 100s of audiobooks without spending a penny! Hope this helps at least one of you x
Loc’D Booktician - You are so awesome! I think John Walters May have a point.... I think access comes into play here also. But I understand the quote to a degree

Kee Mansell - Not gonna lie I got super excited when you mentioned Murakami! I am currently reading Wind-Up Bird Chronincals (nearly finished) and even though I've only read two of his works He's definitely a favourite of mine already.
Snaillo - literally haven’t even finished this video yet and i’m hitting subscribe. this is a cute ass video that kept me entertained the entire time and when you slapped the sponsor right in the middle of it i wasn’t even phased i was like “aw shit she got me” and i was really pleased by the way you explained it lol

Melissa Maldonado - I saw the movie of Perfume like a decade ago and I decided to pick up the book on audio through my library and it is SO. GOOD. If you are looking to re-read it I highly recommend the audio. Thanks for the recommendation!
Katelin - you should read 1Q84 if you haven't already!! it's my favorite Murakami book (he's also my favorite author!)
Temitope Oketikun - I love your energy
Addison Schultz - you should read killing commendatore!!! its murakami's newest release (i think) and its so good, probably my favorite of his books. it definitely can drone on though, worse than wind-up bird chronicles but its one of my favorite storyline of his
Zinon Kalas - You go read ""TAO TE CHING"" by Lao Tzu/if you have not done that already. :)
Grettel BH - CAMI, PLEAAAASE READ BOOKS BY ALICE OSEMAN
Elle Giovengo - This is going to sound weird but I’m going to say it anyway. Your TEETH are so WhiTE anD BeAUtiFUL hOw?
Sophia Sakura B. - I love You so muchhhh
Vanessa Amaya - Books are better than ebooks, what I do is read when I was chill-axing on my bed reading my books
sheya - Subscribed at edumicate😂
luna palm 🌙 - these are the most hipster books
saaaaaaaaes - Loved this video! You comment at the end that you wish you could buy time made me think about a book I just read called ""utopia for realists"". It's all about how to reach a utopia which could solve many of the problems of our society right now, just like having no time and no leisure. You should check it out 😋
AMELIA ANN - Are you the same person on a channel that used to be something about bananas or something? Ur cool
Stormy Evans - Whats you picks on spirituality and consciousness?
Alexis Sherie - Kafka on the shore!!!!!!! I was just thinking about re-reading that.
Aracely Martinez - a word you can use is setting! instead of atmosphere??? LOL

colbythegamer45 ! - Can we be friends??😂 I love  your vibe
Le Lo - God answered my prayers within a few hours, I see.
Mel Rox - I love to read But haven't had the time. I guess now's the time lol.  I love the movie Dracula but maybe I should read the book. Perfume isn't that the book that Kurt Cobain loved.  I've always wanted to read that.
Whateveridontcaremeh - Welp when I was 20 I was deep in depression and I gave away all of my videogames and books. I'm glad people don't follow that one quote or I would've been even more depressed
Shadowmoon Tarot - Perfume is a book I read more than 20 years ago and I still remember it!If nothing else it is really unique! The Picture of Dorian Grey is one of my favourite classics as well...I feel that it is a book that can generate different feelings depending on which perspective you examine it from...Personally I wasn't surprised by its plot twists but I found really interesting that regardless of whether you agree with the author's view point or not, this story and all the subjects it touches (ie friendship, loyalty, deceipt,narcissism, love etc) generate emotions that lend themselves to thought-provoking questions. :) The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy was good as well...I enjoyed books 1+2 more than the last one ...but still...happy to have read them! Looking forward to reading some of the other books you mentioned! Thank you for sharing! Stay home and stay safe! :) xx
Rebeccaxx - Holy shit I love your earrings.
She Reads And Hoards - Haruki Murakami ♡

Frank Pearce Tramp Alone - Hi book lovers, it's a good day for reading

Also; Anne Rice, Kafka, Poe and Arto Paasilinna might be worth mentioning too. Thanks for sharing, dear <3
bts army - I am from India 😊
Grass _ - Okay!okay! but pls tell me something about the book.
Emma Berger - I read the girl with the dragon tattoo and I didn’t like it :( it’s like a slow paced thriller. I feel like if I knew that going into it I would’ve liked it more. I read Norwegian wood by Murakami this year and enjoyed it a lot! I reccomend that one as well! Less magical than the others tho haha
excited elastic bands - GAHH I LOVE PERFUME WHO TF HATES IT!!!! COME FIGHT ME
Anna Lopez - Be my girlfriend
Ellen Dodd - Perfume is my favourite book! If you want something with a similar gross, gritty world (with fantastic narration) you must check out the Crimson Petal & the White by Faber. It's incredible and dirty and I wish it was longer (which says a lot because i think its over 600 pages). I was so sad when it was over.
Sanket Jadhav - wait, where is SupremeBANANA?????
What Dreams Are Made Of - ♥️♥️♥️
Tiina H - Haruki Murakami is so great!!
Alexa Dewar - I feel the way you feel about Haruki Murakami about Erin Morgernstern 😭 if you’re at a loss for dreamy and incredibly unique books to read please try The Night Circus and The Starless Sea!!! Her writing style is just URGH. Everyone needs to appreciate it lol
E. Lew - You crack me up and as for John Waters, he is correct.
Lil Vels - AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa brave new world is so good
Braden Salter - lol you can read 600 pages in two days. I try and read and wind up reading 20 pages, then stopping and here I am 4 months later trying to start it again and try and like reading. Need help lol
AbCadab - wanna know what would be sexy?? if cami joined the booktube community
Martin Stainer - Yes to Perfume. Yes to Dorian Gray and definitely yes to all the Murakami. Although I would have added Norwegian Wood to the list.
Caline Karam - Where did you get your shirt from? I’m obsessed!!!!
Ally De Hav - How many beds you got in this video girl? 😂
cosmic_lotus_eater - Ok I found my book soul mate!!!! The way you talk about n are passionate about books is basically ME!!! And your taste is awesome!! Murakami? Bukowski? Lovecraft? Talk books to me gurl!!! I wonder if you have read n also like Han Kang and Camus?
Also I'm a sapiosexual n you definitely turned me on 😆🙈
Nah Mean - To pronounce Grenouille from Perfume you say 'gron-wee'.
Karlee Valentino - (I look over at my bookshelf) Yeah, I think i am going to be okay. You are right though it is a complete turn off when you find yourself not being able to talk about books you have in common with anyone. 

My bookshelf is separated by classical, to The Lost Generation authors, to autobiographies, Poertry and recent authors.
Userk - Great vid!
Nsd Fancy - Roses are red
Violets are blue 
This video starts at 1:22
ginsoakedgirl4 - Based on your picks you should definitely read Geek Love by Katharine Dunn!!!
Charlotte Bernhard - The Memory Police by Yoko Ogawa
jazmyne Jackson777 - I loved videos like thisssssss. Oml.
sav - I know this comment is 3 months late but I'm waiting on The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo to come in mail ahhhh 😩 I'm lowkey hyped for it & I've always wanted to read it too so why not buy it😅
Aryana Grahgrah - You kinda look like Maeve Wiley
Hamzy shalbob - I dont like books I only listen to a lot of audiobooks
toby1036 - Your energy is very comforting.

Anna Kaplan - you need to read a wild sheep chase by murakami!! my absolute favorite
TheAniPB - actually watched the whole audible blurb because your personality is so vibrant!!!
Ruth Acosta - Ughhh lol I left The Darkest Minds (Alexandra Bracken) and The Trespasser (Tana French) at my s/o 🏡 during the quarantine so I hope I can find these books on the LIBBY APP! It’s FREE and you get access to a library’s e-books as long as you have a library card. 💕
Luana - heard your intro about books being sexy and immediately subscribed
Sona Dasgupta - Try Assassin blade by sarah j mass

shea __ - Where can you read books for free? Or download pdf versions for free?
Sanjana Ghosh - I didn't like girl with the dragon tattoo 😞
Hildita - I agree 100% with your review of TGWTDT. The first 100 pages were soooo slow!! I remember I read this book in high school and I got all my friends to read it and convinced them by saying those exact words lol
Shea Carothers - Totally understand the lure of bukowski as he used to be one of my faves as well! All of his books are actually based on his life, which also means he was a giant rapist - his violence towards women in all his novels are what made me stop reading. since he’s dead no major harm done there, just something to think about
Del Winterbottom Books - Author Of Epic Fiction - ...Can you hear that?



...Well?
Name Me - So everywhere i go for book lists, Dracula has to be there...
I was sarcastic about it at the beginning but turned out it was a book which was to be my most favorite. If you notice many fictional books have unreasonable reasons for revenge...
But the author just nailed it. And here is a little spoiler alert to explain it, there is a scene where a person is confronted by wolves and then he says to himself that it's only when man faces these kind of dangers that he starts to understand their importance...
umar sardar - Here's my list:
1:ACOTAR series
2:Throne of Glass series
3:Crescent City
Mia Luise - you have.... so much energy?? how????
Allison Quiros vargas - I want to be your friend. And, i guess just be able to hear your blabbering about books. It's amazing really. Your enthusiasm is contagiously magnificent. Sorry if my writing is, shit, my mother tongue is Spanish. Saludos, sigue así, enserio. Haces que la gente se sienta aceptada. Y adoro tu pelo. Totally want that on me.
That’s A. Moret - Murakami is a genius.
In Nature Tarot - 1,000,000 % Agree about Kafka on the Shore!! Ugh! So good.
Amruta Mahajan - Turned out to be gay anyway - girl, same
aromal Ks - I love your awesome presentation
Sniffles - Do you still like writing poetry? Or are you more focused on your songwriting?
Ben Jenkins - If you like Stieg Larson the The Harry Hole series by Jo Nesbø is a MUST read.
Nick Ground - So.... have you read Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu??👀
jana belsito - if you like cynicism, a really fun short story is ""Cannabalism in the Cars"" by Mark Twain. It's very off the wall humor and I think is pretty relate-able to modern politics.
Kol Redbird - So incase you didn’t know, Dracula was inspired by a short novella about a Lesbian vampire! Carmilla is an 1872 Gothic novella by Irish author Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, there is also a Carmella web series here on YouTube that’s so good!!
Abdulla Alyaqoob - https://bookerystore.com/downloads/enthralled/
Tyana Putri - Well books is the only thing that allows u to admired ur fantasy and dive deeper into it.....

Feeling Good - My whole classmates are bookworms n they literally wrap every book they have n brings them to school then they'll exchange books n so on..so as a beginner I'm trying to push myself n see what's the excitement of reading so wish me luck!!!
Salam Almahi - I don't know if I'll like all the books you recommended, because for example; I HATED The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, but Perfume is one of my favorite books!!And I really don't vibe with Murukami, but Oscar Wilde is my favorite classical author, and I love Bukowski as well.

EITURKEY1 - Fantastic video, your enthusiasm and intelligence is breathtaking. when you get a chance read Battle Cry by Leon Uris, semi autobiographical,
tharcblack - I haven't read Murakami yet, but I very much approve of all the other choices. Perfume is SO good. I read it in high-school and the film adaptation was SO WELL DONE.
Eleonora Giannetti - well... too bad I already read them all LOL 
I love Murakami, i am collecting all of his books. I am reading them in Italian since it's my motherlanguage, but I feel like I need to have those beautiful covers as well!! Have you read ""South of the border, West of the sun""? so far my fave!
Laura - You should read the Mistborn triology
Storme Brown - Books are sexy 😎
Melissa Sirois - If you love gothic books so much you should read ..la sombra del viento by Ruiz Zafon One of my top ten if not top 5 books on my personal favorite list.

Alice Giuditta - Tai Lopez? Is that you??
TRacyLC89 - Please, read Unchangeable spots of leopards 🐆 by kristohper jansma. Literary fiction that you will never ever forget. One of the best books I have ever read 📚

Jonah Sanford - I want to marry you
PRDGM - i always feel a bit self conscious cuz i kinda agree with that john waters quote and i read a lot but it's almost all ebooks cuz i don't like them taking up physical space. lol time to buy some more
Sophie Wright - do you guys find that having read so many books throughout ur lifetimes that it actually really helps with your essay writing for school?
Andrea Felix - Dracula had NOTHING to do on that list, sorry xD
krissykrissylove - BOOKS ARE VERRRRRRY SEXXXXYYYY!!
bts army - Make a roast on 5 minute craft
Thyra Misuu - MURAKAMI IS A GOD YAAAAAS
Read More - Books are sexy. Yes!
Iggi Braineater - I'm currently reading 'the butchering art' by Lindsey Fitzharris. A depiction of Joseph Lister's career as a surgeon and how he changed the Victorian medicine! Very vivid but definitely worth it!

Btw: I missed E. A. Poe in your video! 😂🖤
Carly Bryant - 5:22 ........have u ever considered acting miss petyn???????

Jamie Clarkson - I've heard the dragon with the dragon tattoo book is degrading to women and kinda offensive
Amber Kernaghan - There is two books on your list that I have. One I haven't read yet while the other book i can't put down. Perfume is the book I haven't read but I saw the movie which got me wanting to read the book. The other one is the girl with the dragon tattoo. I need to read the books after the third one which has been coming out the past few year. But those books are amazing. I need to check out the other one you have said. This is the first time I saw your channel and I'm going to keep watching your channel. Thanks for the video
Joshua Phillips - How do you guys get through books in 2 or 3 days?
cherrie janelle - you can bet on anything that i will now go on a search for the girl with the dragon tattoo because i do find mysteries to be very much interesting and also those books by haruki murakami since i appreciate anything weirdly imaginative

My first book is now only available in Dutch (called 'Het meisje dat haar vijand omarmt' or 'The girl who hugs her enemy' in English) and its sold already 500 times.

saleemtar - Alux.Com kindly recommend books, WHICH make you a good human, history etc.,   or how is our  future, , meaning future  of humanity and other living and non living things  threatened? Because I tend to believe that non- living things are also creation of God with purpose, there is religious philosophy giving importance to both living and inanimate things, and few of American founding  fathers believed and practiced it.  "" Animism"" is its name. 
Sunpreet Singh - Hey Alux Veda is not Holi book of any religion. If you think about Hinduism, I want to be very clear Hinduism is not a single religion but a envelope of small religions originated in India. I don't want to criticise as you do a really good job but it is always good to know about mistakes. My advice is to Avoid anything related to  Hinduism or Hinduvta (both are separate things) as it's a very hot topic in India and can land you in trouble. You can work on it after things get settle down in India.

And when I achieve that I really want to find the one and start a family ❤️🙂

Mozzarella - Don Quijote is THE masterpiece of Spanish literature, we study the book and his author, Miguel de Cervantes in deep in our school years and is usual to find people in Spain (like, everyone in my family can)that are able to recite you the first page complete out memory.

Took me about two weeks just to read the first Percy Jackson series as an adult. LOL. But I especially love classics, my favorites being Austen and Bronte, but those are even more time-consuming. MAD RESPECT. I have The Count of Monte Cristo on my list, but as for Wuthering Heights... that was unreadable for me... Emily's sister are much better at novels. I leave Emily to her poems.

amin jamal mungin - “Steve jobs was a horrible human being and I’d never wanna be anything like him” 
—-Anonymous
Abderrahman Ezzafati - Steve Jobs:
1. The innovator's dilemma
2. Only the paranoid survive
3. The way of the white clouds
Navtesh Dhir - Insanely Simple (book no. 10) was published in 2012, one year after Steve's death.
Baiju Ashar - My next book to read would be “Autobiography of a Yogi” by Paramhansa Yogananda. Thanks
O'SSÉIN - If a visionary speaks, we better listen.
Subzero - Gates was an Engineer at heart, Jobs was an Artist.p

Alux: Book #1 The Innovators Dilemma

No one would be like him. I have read his biography by Walter isaacson. Great book
Real Genius - You guys forgot cosmic consciousness , that’s the book that took him to India 🇮🇳
Julio Exposito - Wooow, me too I love spiritual books, i’m going to read all of them
fuckyoubitch - you're welcome


1. The innovators dilemma - Clayton m. christensen
Eduardo J Roque - How incredible it is the more than 70% of those book are topics related to inner self. “You can find all the information out there, but the best one is in ourself” Knowing ourself is the fundamental key to success in life. Be careful: that doesn’t mean we know everything. Have a open mind to accumulate as much information as possible and conclude it at what work for you. We all have a greater in us. We just need to find.
AMAZING - My favorite things in life don't cost any money. It's really clear that the most precious resource we all have is TIME. - #stevejobs

vishal jaravta - Read books for your immediate effect! Love the line Aluxa.
Tom - It is very interesting that Jobs was so spiritual yet he was a complete a hole to everyone around him. He never gave to charity and was incredibly self centred. Is that  what the word Paradox means?

Syed Noor Mohammed - ""When to read?"" Superb idea..
Torry Terry - hello my name is Torry Terry, and I am the Author of the book ""The Locks Hated on with a smile."" I am from Miami Florida and was lucky enough to have a stepfather who was one of the original Gangsters from a city called Opa-Locka in Miami Florida named Chilly Willie.  he told me how it was in the late 80's and early 90's in Miami involving the African Americans. too many times we hear about the Cubans and the Colombians back then, but rarely the Black people.
